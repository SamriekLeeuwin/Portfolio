# Sem Leeuwin - Student Developer Portfolio

Hey! This is my portfolio website where I show off the stuff I've been working on as a Software Engineering student.

## What's This?

This is my personal portfolio site that I built to:
- Show my projects (some work, some don't)
- Practice my frontend skills
- Learn about deployment and DevOps stuff

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** - Basic structure
- **CSS** - Styling (tried to keep it simple)
- **JavaScript** - Basic functionality like tabs and smooth scrolling
- **Docker** - For easy deployment (still learning this)

## How to Run It

### Option 1: Simple (Just open the file)
```bash
# Navigate to the web folder
cd src/web

# Just open index.html in your browser
# Or use a simple server:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then go to http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: With Docker (if you have it installed)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamriekLeeuwin/portfolio.git
cd portfolio/src/web
docker compose up --build
```

## What I'm Working On

- Learning more about backend development
- Trying to understand cloud services
- Getting better at JavaScript and TypeScript
- Planning to add more projects as I build them
